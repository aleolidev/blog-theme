  Gatsby's blog theme by Kaktus
</h1>

This topic is focused on creating blogs with Amazon Affiliate referral articles and deploying them on Netlify. The goal is to achieve an environment optimized for SEO both in content and performance and with a fully focused Amazon affiliate experience in the shortest possible time.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

> **NOTE**: _We assume that you already have an environment ready to run a Gatsby project_

1.  **Clone the theme in your preferred foler.**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/inmortalkaktus/blog-theme my-blog
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies and start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install the dependencies with the following commands.

    ```shell
    cd my-blog/
    npm i
    ```

    Once the process has finished, execute the following command to be able to preview your blog

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

## ðŸŽ¨ Personalization

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

If from your code editor you search for `TODO:`, you will find all the parameters that you should customize before launching your blog.

To modify the logo and favicon, you can find them in `/src/images/logo.svg` and `/static/favicon.ico` respectively

If you want to create or modify articles, you can find them inside your project folder at `/src/articles/`.

To make correct use of the i18n system (internationalization), you must specify within the `.mdx` file in question, the language code to which the article is directed. You can see the examples that are by default and take them as a reference.

## ðŸ’« Deploy

The project is created to be deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which is completely free. To do this, you just have to create an account, create your own github repository with your project, and import it. You don't need any extra configuration!
